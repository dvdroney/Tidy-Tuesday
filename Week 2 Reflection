Goal was to limit start to finish to 90 minutes, which I did.
Spent a good deal of time on the label and getting that with an arrow. That was new learning and seemed smooth once I got it done.
Overall this week is a better end product than last week.
The graph I did not finish would have zoomed in on the previous graph.
Still need to learn about themes more to save time in the future.
